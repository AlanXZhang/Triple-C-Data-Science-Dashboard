Stop throwing your money away Renting! Buy and get a set in mortgage that will never rise again for around the same amount or maybe even less then renting!! Get rid of that landlord for life and you will not be at the mercy of that 30-day notice. Don't forget the huge tax advantages and the equity you will be building each month as you pay. When you buy you get a bundle of rights as a homeowner and you get out of that temporary living situation. Its your turn to get a nice new home!!!!

About North Park. 
North Park is minutes from downtown San Diego, Balboa Park, the world famous San Diego Zoo, 32nd street Naval Base, PetCo Park, Qualcom Stadium, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. San Diego receives about 300 days of sunshine a year. North Park is located on an elevated plateau and although there may be fog (June Gloom) on the beaches, North Park tends to be sunnier earlier in the mornings. The weather is gorgeous most of the year! For weekend outings, there are the near by mountains, the city of Julian (an official California Historical Landmark), Mexico, the Anza Borrego Desert, numerous Parks in the city and San Diego County also has some of the best hiking trails in the nation. 

Restaurants and Nightlife buzz with activity daily.
North Park offers an amazing choice of restaurants from Fast Food to Ethiopian, Lebanese, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Italian, Mexican and American restaurants, just to name a few. There are mini breweries, bars and nightclubs. Less than 5 minutes drive to the south is downtown San Diego and even more restaurants and clubs, with many in the ""Gas Lamp Quarter"".

Transportation.
Bike lanes and bike routes on the main thoroughfares are increasing as bike routes are added to new streets in the area. There are many bus routes and it is easy to connect to the trolley lines as well. The area is centrally located within several surrounding Interstate and state highways, including Interstates 805, 15, 8, and 5, and highways 163, 94, and 15 nearby.

Shopping.
The North Park area has thrift shops, collectibles and novelty stores. For grocery's there is Vons, Barons and Target in the neighborhood. North Park also hosts a farmers market every Thursday afternoon on the 3000 block of North Park Way. Minutes away from North Park to the west, toward the Hillcrest area, are Trader Joe's, Sprout's, Ralph's and Whole Foods grocery stores.

Parks and Beaches.
The area boasts Bird Park, North Park Community Park, and Morley Field. Morley Field has open grassy areas to play Frisbee, football, or just bask in the Sun. North Park Community Park features a playground for the kids and a recreation center that houses basketball, tennis and handball courts. Bird Park features an open, grassy area where you can have a picnic or just enjoy the scenic views. San Diego's largest and most famous park is, of course, Balboa Park and is only 5 minutes to the South.
Beaches abound. La Jolla Cove is a great destination for Scuba diving, snorkeling, seal watching, surfing, and swimming, lounging in the sun and is only 15 minutes to the northwest. Just South of La Jolla Cove is Pacific Beach where Surf and Sand are defined. There is the Board Walk which is actually concrete that is along the beach. You will see bicyclist, joggers and many enjoying this concrete path. There are many Shops and Restaurants to complete a fantastic fun day at the Beach. Further to the South there is Mission Beach with the world's largest wooden roller coaster and several bays for jet skiing, sail boarding, and campfire pits on Fiesta Island.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Extra storage space in garage. Walk to beaches and restaurants. Quick access to the I-5.

In addition to the replacement of siding and fencing as part of the renovation of the Del Mar Woods complex, the outdoor decking was replaced on the downstairs patio, the atrium off the kitchen and the upstairs balcony. Additionally, a new air conditioner and furnace were installed and new cable railings were added as an upgrade over the standard railings offered in the renovation. In 2015, all the kitchen and laundry appliances were replaced - including adding a SubZero refrigerator/freezer - and the water heater was replaced. In 2014, all of the doors and windows were replaced with new Fleetwood doors and windows. In 2005, there was a complete remodel, down to the studs.","[2, '3', '2200', '105 Spinnaker Ct']","[<span>cats are OK - purrr</span>, <span>dogs are OK - wooof</span>, <span>flooring: <b>wood</b></span>, <span>furnished</span>, <span>townhouse</span>, <span>w/d in unit</span>, <span>attached garage</span>]"

Stop throwing your money away Renting! Buy and get a set in mortgage that will never rise again for around the same amount or maybe even less then renting!! Get rid of that landlord for life and you will not be at the mercy of that 30-day notice. Don't forget the huge tax advantages and the equity you will be building each month as you pay. When you buy you get a bundle of rights as a homeowner and you get out of that temporary living situation. Its your turn to get a nice new home!!!!

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Great location for walking to local businesses, the beach, Birdrock, Garnet or even Mission Bay on the Fourth of July. All properties to the north and to the east are single family homes, so the area is lower density which means there is ample guest parking and the neighborhood is peaceful yet still active.Text  show contact info
 ! There are a wide variety of businesses within a couple of blocks including cafes, restaurants, pilates/yoga, salons, gas, groceries, boutiques, dry cleaning, seamstress, hardware, gardening. Trader Joes, Henrys and Vons are all within 5 minutes away, and Gelson's is a short walk for easy grocery shopping. The beach, bay, Kate Sessions park, La Jolla, Birdrock and Pacific Beach provide ample nearby weekend diversion. Can't beat fresh croissants, coffee and baguettes from The French Gourmet, surf sessions with the mature crowd at Tourmaline Beach, a healthy dose of Hawiian hospitality at Lelanis for breakfast or the farmers market in La Jolla on Sunday mornings.","[2, '2', '2000', None]","[<span>cats are OK - purrr</span>, <span>dogs are OK - wooof</span>, <span>flooring: <b>tile</b></span>, <span>condo</span>, <span>w/d in unit</span>, <span>off-street parking</span>, <span>rent period: <b>monthly</b></span>]"

Walk into this condo, and you will instantly feel at home. This is a 2-bedroom/2-bath with a HUGE bonus room that can be used as a third bedroom, large family room, or office.

Bamboo wood flooring, custom kitchen with quartz counter tops, new appliances/lighting and in-unit washer/dryer make this a great refuge. Sit out on the porch that opens into a lush and tropical courtyard area with a community pool.

This first-floor unit is far from any street noise, and very close to a back entrance (into a quiet cul de sac) that allows for quick and easy access to La Jolla Shores beach, shopping, and dining.

Monthly rent includes ALL utilities, including basic cable and basic internet. Parking included.

Considering leases for 6 to 12 months. Monthly income must be at least 2.5x monthly rent.

The San Diego Yacht Club is directly across the street, Southwestern Yacht Club, Shelter Island and numerous Point Loma eateries and small businesses are 1 - 4 blocks away.

Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

I'm looking for a new roommate for immediate move in to take over an open room in my two-bedroom apartment. It's located in North Park, walking distance to both Balboa Park and plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops. It's a really chill area, lots to do and bike friendly. University Heights and Hillcrest are also right around the corner. 

The room is unfurnished with a sliding glass door closet. My old roommate moved cross country for a new job and left behind a lot of his furniture for the living room. I haven't decided if I'm going to keep it or get new stuff. Of course if whoever moves in has living room furniture they want to bring along, that's definitely an option too. I'm in the process of redecorating, so there's a lot of blank walls and whatnot for now. Definitely open for help making the place more.... homey. The bathroom, kitchen, and living room are shared spaces. There's a storage closet and small outdoor garage. It's a bit tight for a car... I'm debating on turning it into some kind of activity space, or just using it as storage, which is what it is right now. 

A little about me...
I'm 32, f,  and work as an environmental scientist. I'm still somewhat new to the city so I spend a lot of my free time exploring what it has to offer. It would definitely be a bonus to have somebody move in that has suggestions on SoCal gems to visit. I love anything outdoors, hiking, biking, yoga, camping, road trips, etc. I also like going out around town, but definitely like chill time at the house too. I'm totally cool with gatherings and guests, but not looking to host any raging parties or anything. Just looking for somebody respectful of shared spaces and people in general. Must be 420 friendly. No homophobes, no racists, no Trump supporters. No room for hate or negativity  here. 


The basics:
Rent - $1000 a month, month-to-month
Utilities - landlord covers water and trash, gas, electric, and internet we share (usually $50-$75 a month)
Laundry - coin operated, on-site (the complex is small, so it's close)
Pets - I have one sweet cat, unfortunately she doesn't like sharing with other animals so no other pets : (


I'm looking for somebody to move in right away. If you have any other questions, just ask.","[1, 'shared', '1000', None]","[<span>apartment</span>, <span>laundry on site</span>, <span>street parking</span>]"

 to text with us.APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  This is a 2 Bedroom, 2.5 Bath, approximately 1155 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer.

APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Other charming touches in these fully renovated apartments include brand new kitchens with ALL new appliances, new cabinets, counters, brand new closets, new heaters, new flooring, new paint, crown molding, new recessed lighting, complete new bathrooms, new ceiling fans, with a beautiful new courtyard housing a tranquil water feature. Small, quiet complex with laundry room and use of Kayaks and Paddle Boards! Just a few units left, both upstairs and downstairs. 

These fully renovated units are just across the street to the famous Kellogg Beach! Close to yacht clubs, shopping, fine dining, and walking trails and right up the street from the Naval Base! In the heart of the prestigious La Playa neighborhood! This area offers unparalleled beach and water access, making it ideal for many water sports and activities including kayaking, SUP, walking, running, cycling, fishing and sailing. The San Diego Yacht Club is directly across the street, Southwestern Yacht Club, Shelter Island and numerous Point Loma eateries and small businesses are 1 - 4 blocks away. Most major San Diego attractions are less than a 10 minute drive from the condo; SD airport and Liberty station (Trader Joes, Vons, many eateries and services) are a 5 minute drive. The apartment location makes it an extremely attractive alternative to a downtown high rise or a residential area home with no view. It is hard to find an area in San Diego that presents this much opportunity for fun and recreation while still enjoying the feeling of living in a seaside village.

APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Hello, my name is Clay I’m a USMC Veteran and a Government Contractor for the US Navy. My old roommate has recently moved out of state; and I still have considerable amount of time on the lease. Which is up July 2022, and I will most likely renew it for another year. The apartment complex is the “Modern Apartments” which is in the middle of the 805 and the 163. It’s close to both Mesa College and Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, making it an ideal place for either flight school student or a Mesa college student. I’m renting out the “Master Bedroom”14.7ft * 13.6ft. It is an apartment/ town house 2 beds, 1.5 baths, 950 sq ft. You will treated as an actual roommate. You will have full access to the kitchen, dining room, living room and patio. I also have a small terrier mix, and a dog is allowed; if they get along. I want a roommate that is respectable and responsible, I’ll be the same. I would like to have either or both a college student or another Veteran. If you’re neither it’s cool! Also, have the rent on the first no questions and I only take money by Venmo or direct deposit through Navy Federal. Drinking is allowed, but smoking will be done out on the Patio. I currently pay $2,409; I split it in half making my asking price “$1,205” a month with no security deposit. That’s not including the renters insurance, Spectrum and the SDG&E that aren’t very high; we’ll both split those bills. The room is ready to be rented right now! Also we have to meet up, before we agree on you moving in. Below is the link to the apartment complex, my contact information and required information below.

APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Private detached studio granny-flat for rent. Brand new kitchenette, closet, windows and floors. On the smaller side, approximately 240 sqft. Perfect for someone who doesn't have a ton of stuff. Available now, but flexible on the move in date for the right person.

All utilities are included (Electric, water and Cox Gigablast internet).

Great location - North of Adams, so tucked back against the canyon. Walking distance to all of the bars, restaurants and shops on Adams, but this is a quiet neighborhood and you will be living behind the main house, so it's important that you are respectful. No dedicated parking, but there is plenty of street parking.

Looking for a 6-month lease then month to month.

Stop throwing your money away Renting! Buy and get a set in mortgage that will never rise again for around the same amount or maybe even less then renting!! Get rid of that landlord for life and you will not be at the mercy of that 30-day notice. Don't forget the huge tax advantages and the equity you will be building each month as you pay. When you buy you get a bundle of rights as a homeowner and you get out of that temporary living situation. Its your turn to get a nice new home!!!! Call Alex your local ""Keller Williams Realtor"" today to find out your options. I can and will get you a great deal!!!

These spectacular 1-bedroom/1-bathroom units have been beautifully upgraded throughout! Stunning, Oversized, brand-new windows are everywhere, providing copious natural light. Other charming touches in these fully renovated apartments include brand new kitchens with ALL new appliances, new cabinets, counters, brand new closets, new heaters, new flooring, new paint, crown molding, new recessed lighting, complete new bathrooms, new ceiling fans, with a beautiful new courtyard housing a tranquil water feature. Small, quiet complex with laundry room and use of Kayaks and Paddle Boards! Just a few units left, both upstairs and downstairs. 

These fully renovated units are just across the street to the famous Kellogg Beach! Close to yacht clubs, shopping, fine dining, and walking trails and right up the street from the Naval Base! In the heart of the prestigious La Playa neighborhood! This area offers unparalleled beach and water access, making it ideal for many water sports and activities including kayaking, SUP, walking, running, cycling, fishing and sailing. The San Diego Yacht Club is directly across the street, Southwestern Yacht Club, Shelter Island and numerous Point Loma eateries and small businesses are 1 - 4 blocks away. Most major San Diego attractions are less than a 10 minute drive from the condo; SD airport and Liberty station (Trader Joes, Vons, many eateries and services) are a 5 minute drive. The apartment location makes it an extremely attractive alternative to a downtown high rise or a residential area home with no view. It is hard to find an area in San Diego that presents this much opportunity for fun and recreation while still enjoying the feeling of living in a seaside village.

Requirements: Income 2 1/2 times rent, NO evictions, good credit and rental history. $40/adult application fee.","[1, '1', '2695', 'Kellogg St near Rosecrans']","[<span>application fee details: <b>$40/adult application fee</b></span>, <span>cats are OK - purrr</span>, <span>dogs are OK - wooof</span>, <span>apartment</span>, <span>laundry on site</span>, <span>off-street parking</span>, <span>rent period: <b>yearly</b></span>]"
