The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.
